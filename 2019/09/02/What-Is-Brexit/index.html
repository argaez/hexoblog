	<p class="text-justify"></p><p>Britain’s two main political parties are haggling over the nation’s withdrawal from the European Union, but even with the departure on hold for the next few months, the badly divided government remains in crisis, unable to agree on an approach to the country’s biggest peacetime decision in decades.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Theresa May paid for the struggles with her job, announcing on May 24 that she would resign after failing to come up with a plan that satisfied her party, her coalition partners and officials in Brussels. On July 23, the Conservative Party chose Boris Johnson, a brash proponent of withdrawal, to succeed her and take control of the Brexit process.</p>
<p>Parliament soundly rejected the plan that Mrs. May negotiated with the European Union for the departure, commonly known as Brexit, and the bloc twice postponed the exit date. Unable to win over enough members of her own Conservative Party, Mrs. May eventually tried to negotiate with the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn. Those talks collapsed.</p>
<p>The deadline is effectively Oct. 31, and all options remain on the table, including leaving without a deal — a situation that many fear will be economically damaging. At the other extreme, abandoning Brexit altogether is still a possibility, as are assorted approaches in between, varying in how closely Britain would remain tied to European trade rules.</p>
<p>In late August, Mr. Johnson, who has promised that he can hammer out a new agreement by the October deadline, shortened the time Parliament has left to debate, potentially increasing the chances of a no-deal Brexit. The move threatened to test the country’s political system, and was denounced as a “constitutional outrage” by John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Worrying about the consequences of Brexit with or without a deal, and even of an indefinite delay, some companies have moved operations to other countries. There are also fears of medicine and food shortages after a no-deal departure.</p>
<p>What ultimately emerges could determine the shape of Britain and its place in the world for decades. Following is a basic guide to Brexit, what it is, how it developed into the mess it is today and how it could ultimately be resolved.</p>
<p>What is Brexit?<br>A portmanteau of the words “Britain” and “exit,” Brexit is shorthand for Britain’s split from the European Union, changing its relationship to the bloc on trade, security and migration.</p>
<p>Britain has been debating the pros and cons of membership in a European community of nations almost from the moment the idea was broached. It held its first referendum on membership in what was then called the European Economic Community in 1975, less than three years after it joined, when 67 percent of voters supported staying in the bloc.</p>
<p>In 2013, Prime Minister David Cameron promised a national referendum on European Union membership with the idea of settling the question once and for all. The options it offered were broad and vague — Remain or Leave — and Mr. Cameron was convinced that Remain would win handily.</p>
<p>Britons voted on June 23, 2016, as a refugee crisis made migration a subject of political rage across Europe and amid accusations that the Leave campaign had relied on lies and broken election laws. An ill-defined Brexit won 52 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>Not only did that not settle the debate, but it also saved for another day the tangled question of what should come next. After nearly three years of debate and negotiation, that remains unanswered.</p>
<p>How did the vote break down?<br>Most voters in England and Wales supported Brexit, particularly in rural areas and smaller cities. That overcame majority support to remain in the European Union in London, Scotland and Northern Ireland. See a detailed map of the vote.</p>
<p>Young people overwhelmingly voted against leaving, while older voters supported it.</p>
